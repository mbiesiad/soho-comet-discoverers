## TODO

✅ Good to see - languages versions [ie. 'locale' directory].

✅ Add more formats (ie. json, xml) [separate catalog].

✅ Add discoveries for >=2016

✅ It would be interesting to create statistics for individual years, it would also show the activity of discoverers in given years [separate catalog]

_Update: last updated 2020/7/8_

## Translations

For translations please make other branch for your changes & before PR (ie. for Spain will be: es_ES etc).

If you want, you can also add 'Translated by:' (ie. @JohnSmith) with link to your GitHub account or Twitter handle. Thank you!
