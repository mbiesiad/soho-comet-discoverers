## TODO

✅ Good to see - languages versions [ie. 'locale' directory].

✅ Add more formats (ie. json, xml) [separate catalog].

✅ Add discoveries for >=2016

✅ It would be interesting to create statistics for individual years, it would also show the activity of discoverers in given years [separate catalog]

✅ It would be interesting to create statistics for nationalities: countries / continents of discoverers. Then we can make a visual map. [separate catalog]

The basic data format should be `csv` here.
